# React-Contacts
This is a Single-Page-App of personal contacts book made with ReactJS. 

You can search, edit, delete or add contacts with it. 

The contact list is stored in local storage, and you can check it later with the updated info. 

This is the first project of React in DigitalCrafts' course. It had been almost one year before I used React again for coding, so I needed to update my knowledge and skills in earnest. This project was a greating training for me.

## Nerd's thinking
### Gains:
- I had gained a refreshment for React by making it

- For the very first time, I began to try React router

### Pains:
- I hadn't learnt React Redux when I was making this app, the interactions of states and props among sibling or parent-children components were like a hell to me
- React router was very difficult to understand in the beginning
- The index.js file was way too big

## Major Techs:
- CSS
- ReactJS
- React Router
